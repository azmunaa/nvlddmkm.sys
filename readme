Stop code: SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED
What failed: nvlddmkm.sy

==============================================

Background of this problem:

This error occurred a few hours after I updated Windows and updated the Nvidia driver through "Nvidia Geforce Experience".

After I investigated it turns out that the file "nvlddmkm.sy" is not in C:\Windows\System32\ and this is the cause of the problem. 

I have reinstalled the Nvidia driver, but the "nvlddmkm.sy" file still does not appear.

==============================================

Solution:

1. Download and install the "Everything" software: https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/
2. type in the search field: "nvlddmkm.sy"
(in my case, the file "nvlddmkm.sy" is found in the folder "C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\nvaci.inf_amd64_bd18144e1d01e587")
3. Copy and paste the file in "C:\Windows\System32\"
4. Restart the computer/laptop, done.
